I am Aakash Saraiya, a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student at Charusat University with a 9.67 CGPA. I have experience as a Software Engineer Trainee at MindArray Systems (Motadata), where I gained expertise in Java, Vert.x, reactive programming, networking, and OS concepts.

I worked on developing a network monitoring system prototype, optimizing data interactions and implementing a Golang-based polling mechanism. My prior internship at DevKrutiTech involved backend migration from Django to PHP, database optimization, and API development.

I have also built serverless applications on AWS, including a ride-sharing app (WildRydes) with Cognito, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. My technical expertise includes Java, Python, Golang, Vert.x, AWS, PostgreSQL, and REST API development.

I am AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate and an active member of the AWS Cloud Club at Charusat. I was also a top 14 finalist at the "HackOut" hackathon at DAIICT.
